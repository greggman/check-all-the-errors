# check-all-the-errors

Loads a bunch of urls and reports on any errors generated by the
browser. In particular JavaScript errors, bad urls (images, css), bad links,
etc...


You give it a base path and an optional sub path. Example

```
check-all-the-errors /Users/me/three.js "examples/*.html"
```

Which will serve the folder `/Users/me/three.js` and test all the
`.html` files in `/Users/me/three.js/examples` by loading them as
`http://localhost:8080/example/somepage.html`.

The point is say you update a dependency or make a major search and replace
change, then you can run this too see if anything on your site broke.

I suspect it's of limited use. Most complex sites have a real testing
suite and require far more manipulation of pages (clicking buttons etc)
but for a mostly static site something simple like this might be useful.

Note you can also run it on a remote site by giving it urls. Example

```
check-all-the-errors --follow-links=local https://threejs.org
```

Similarly you can test it with some other server. For example

```
& servez /path/to/website
check-all-the-errors --follow-links=local http://localhost:8080/index.html
```

This is especially useful if your server does things like respond to path
to a folder with `index.php` or `whateveryouconfigured.somext`.

Note: I can also be helpful to generate/create your own page of links.
For example [threejsfundamentals.org's](https://threejsfundamentals.org)
site builder generates [a page with links to each language](https://threejsfundamentals.org/link-check.html).
since there are no natural links across languages. Passing that page with `--follow-links=local`
will end up finding all pages on the site. Of course you could also pass in
each of those pages but then if new languages are added you'd have to manually
update your configuration.

## Installation

```
npm install -g check-all-the-errors
```

## Usage

```
check-all-the-errors [options] path-to-serve [...glob]
```

**NOTE**: all globs and ignore-patterns are relative to `path-to-serve`
which means you generally need to quote them so the shell does not
expand them in place.

examples:

```
check-all-the-errors somedir              # eqv: somedir/*.html
check-all-the-errors somedir "*.html"     # eqv: somedir/*.html
check-all-the-errors somedir "**/*.html"  # eqv: somedir/**/*.html
check-all-the-errors somedir "foo/*.html" # eqv: somedir/foo/*.html
```

### Options

* `--help` displays help
* `--port=<num>` port (default: 8080), will chose this or higher
* `--timeout=<ms>` the default timeout in ms (default: 20000)
* `--ignore-pattern=<glob>` a glob pattern to ignore (see glob node)
* `--config=<config-file>` a config JavaScript file
* `--verbose` print console.log from browser
* `--output` output results to file as json
* `--dry-run` just print the initial list of files.
* `--follow-links=<type>` follow links (local, remote, both, none)

  note: local links will be loaded and checked for errors,
  remote links will only be checked for a valid response (200-299).

## Config file

The config file's main purpose is to specify expected errors.
For example you have a tutorial that shows loading an image cross
origin fails. That would normally show up as an error but you can
specify in the config file to ignore that error on a per page
basis.

Example config

```js
module.exports = {
  expectedErrors: [
    {
      filter: "webgl-3d-textures.html",
      errors: [
        { type: 'msg', test: "gl.INVALID_OPERATION in generateMipmap", },
      ],
    },
    {
      filter: "webgl-data-textures.html",
      errors: [
        { type: 'msg', test: "gl.INVALID_OPERATION in texImage2D", },
      ],
    },
    {
      filter: "webgl-cors-permission.html",
      errors: [
        { type: 'msg', test: /Uncaught SecurityError.*?cross-origin data/, },
        { type: 'msg', test: "JSHandle@error", },
        { type: 'pageerror', test: "DOMException: Failed to execute 'texImage2D", },
      ],
    },
    {
      filter: "webgl-cors-permission-bad.html",
      errors: [
        { type: 'pageerror', test: "DOMException: Failed to execute 'texImage2D", },
      ],
    },
  ]
};
```

`expectedErrors` is an array of tests, each test has a `filter` which is used
to match the expected errors to a specific page. `filter` can be a string,
in which case if the URL contains that substring it will match. `filter` can
be regular expression. `filter` can also be a function which will be passed
the URL as a string and should return `true` if it's a match.

If it is a match then there is an array of `errors`. Each error has a `type`
which must match one  of `msg`, `exception` `error`, `pageerror`, `badlink`,
or `badResponse`. Each error also as a `test` which like `filter` can be a
string, regular expression, or function. If the test passes the error is ignored.
